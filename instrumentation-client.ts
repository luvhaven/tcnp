 * Browser error monitoring (Sentry).

 * Next.js runs this file after the HTML loads but BEFORE React hydration, so

 *
 * Keep this file cheap: Next warns in development if initialization exceeds
 * 16ms. Session Replay is lazy-loaded by the SDK, so the cost here is the
 * `Sentry.init` call itself.
