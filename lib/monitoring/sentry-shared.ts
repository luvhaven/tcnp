 * Fallback DSN, compiled into the bundle.

 * Normally the DSN comes from the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` environment
 * variable, which is the right place for it. This constant exists for the
 * case where nobody working on the code has access to the deployment
 * platform's environment variables — setting it here still gets errors
 * flowing, because it only needs a commit.
 *
 * Safe to commit: a DSN grants permission to WRITE events and nothing else.
 * It cannot read issues, and it is already readable in the deployed client
 * bundle by anyone who opens devtools.
 *
 * BUT this repository is public, so a DSN placed here is also discoverable by
 * automated scrapers. Before using it, blunt the only real abuse (someone
 * flooding the error quota so real errors get rate-limited away):
 *   1. Sentry > Settings > Projects > tcnp > Client Keys > rate limit the key.
 *   2. Sentry > Settings > Projects > tcnp > Inbound Filters > Allowed
 *      Domains — restrict to the app's own domain.
 *
 * The environment variable always wins, so setting it later needs no code
 * change. See docs/ERROR_MONITORING.md.
